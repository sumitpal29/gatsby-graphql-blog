Configure Firebase Deployment

- if firebase tool isn't installed, install it (globally preferred)

```
  firebase --version
  sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
```

- On app, init firebase and configure if not already

```
  firebase init
```

- All set time to deploy project, run the command and watch the magic

```
  firebase deploy
```

## Run react project

```
  // develop and run on local machine
  yarn start

  // build
  yarn build

  // serve
  yarn serve
```
